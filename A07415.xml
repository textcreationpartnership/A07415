            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>To the right honorable, Phillip, Earle of <hi>Arundell,</hi> Brian Melbancke <hi>wiſheth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of honour, with the full fruition of</hi> perfect felicitie.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE baſeneſſe of this preſent (my verie good Lorde) compared with the woorthineſſe of your honour, may argue me impudent in exhibiting ſuch a gift, &amp; confirme your vvoonted clemencie if you deigne to accept it.</p>
            <p>The firſtlinges of our fruites are due to the Gods, and men are diſcharged if they offer them deuoutly: the prime of my labours I giue to your honour, and I thinke my ſelfe acquited though they be not verie exquiſite. A Caeſars mind vvill vouchſafe a Codrus might, a curte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Laelius vvill giue attention to a ſtammering Lentulus, and Iupiter in that did shew himſelfe Iupiter, that he refuſed not the ſupplication of poore Liberia.</p>
            <p>Meete it vvere, faine I vvould, and I hope I ſhall gratifie your Lordſhip, edifie the Reader, and damnifie none by this ſimple Treatiſe. If your Lordſhips Triple be not to high for my Baſe, I doubt not but my muſicke vvill be indifferent, and if your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour diſdaine not my ſeelie Pamphlet, I hope it vvill be reaſonablie vvelcome to others.</p>
            <p>Had PHILOTIMVS bene ſerued in at the firſt courſe, when your ſtomacke was not quatted vvith other daintier fare, his reliſhe perhaps had beene ſome-thing tooth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: But ſince you are cloied vvith more delicate cates, thus faire notvvithſtanding I dare preſume, to bring him in for a ſhovv among other banqueting diſhes. And as Olautia reioyced, that Thaleſtris the Queene of the Amazons receiued a hoſegay at her handes, though ſhe neuer ſmelled to it: or as Cherilus the rurall Poet trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed, that the great Macedo had ſeene his verſes, though he neuer liked them: So if novv and than you doe but looke on PHILOTIMVS, when other vvaightier affaires do not otherwiſe employ you, I ſhal thinke my ſelfe no ſmal deale happie, that your ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable vievve hath ouerſhadovved my booke.</p>
            <p>The morning is meete for grauer ſtudies, the poſtmeridian for pleaſaunt ſolace, ſo that, PHILOTIMVS which commeth in limping at the latter end of the day, though be be no author for knovvledge of importance, yet may ſome refection by reading his toies, lend recreation to your vvearied Muſes.</p>
            <p>Iuball firſt made the portatiue tentes, ordered his flockes, and appointed vvhen rammes ſhould go to the eyves: Tuball deuiſed the ſcience of muſicke, Tubalcan ſearched out the commodities of mettals, Parmenides inuented the art of Logicke, Saturne firſt taught the conceit of ſhooting, and Noema founde out the miſterie of vveauing: Yet neither the kinde of Deiotorus his graſing, not the commoditie of La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gus
<pb facs="tcp:10522:3"/>
his tent making, nor the commendation of Empedocles his melodie, nor the fame of Vulcans ſmith vvorkes, nor the renoune of Ariſt. Logicke, nor the praiſe of Lancus for weauing of his ſilkes, nor the ſteady hand of Comodus that neuer miſſed marke, are any whit impaired by their predeceſſours praiſe: no more I truſte shall my poore Pamphlet be defaced by the eloquence of them that haue forerun me, (though the compariſon be farre vnequal.)</p>
            <p>Galen vvas a cunning phiſitian, Saluius Iulianus an expert lawyer, Fon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o a diſert orator, Oppian a famous poet, and Maximinus of ſo ſtrong conſtitution, that he vvas able to ſupport anie paines: vvere the properties of all theſe conieſted in me, vvhich am inueſted in none of them all, then vvoulde I trie, vvhether my ſeruice vvere able to ſtande your Lordship in ſome ſtead, to vvhom my ſeruiceable duetie shall be euer obeiſant. But alas (my Lord) a barley graine can but yeeld an eare of barley, and tvvo pence is large vſurie of a poore peny: a mightles marling can afoord but a willing mynd, and a halfepeni-worth of skill, a two-peny Pamphlet.</p>
            <p>If plaine vtterance be no blemish to a very trueth, &amp; truth do not breed ſuſpition of flattery, I proteſt to your honour, that as you haue wonne the hearts of all them, who haue heard of your demeanour: So I amongſt the reſt (though one of the moſt that can doe you leaſt ſeruice) haue in faith and fancie, loue and loyaltie, done vnto you ſuch harty homage, as is more poſſible for you to conceiue, then credible for me to declare to your ſelfe. And this I ſay, that whiles you Mecenas are, a Maro shal you neuer want: VVhiles you endeuour to be an Achilles, an Homers deuoire shall neuer quaile to blaze your praiſe: a vertuous Cyrus will cauſe Zenophon to be elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, and Alexanders valute will make Curtius a good Antiquatie.</p>
            <p>But leaſt you thinke that Plato is turned to Gnato, and my philoſophie chaunged to flatterie, I will rather referre my ſelfe to tyme and triall, then vaynelie vaunt of loyaltie, where there wants (ah) abilitie.</p>
            <p>This therefore (right honorable) is my humble requeſt, that in this warre betwixt NATVRE &amp; FORTVNE, you will vouchſafe to be the vmpeere, whoſe fortune is proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous (long may it laſt) but far inferiour to your nature, whom all men admire. And if at any time hereafter, you ſee vertue ſuppreſſed by caſuall calamitie, you will lende your aſſiſtance to the reſcuing of Vertue, knowing, that Caeſar was more commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded for his curteſie then his cheualrie, and that the onely Vertue which made The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odoſius the Emperor, ſurnamed the yonger, ſo famous, was bountie to the beſt &amp; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fabilitie to all. <hi>Haud facile emergunt</hi> (ſaith the Poet) <hi>quorum virtutibus obſtat res augusta domi,</hi> and oftentimes shall you ſee ineſtimable vertues endarkened with the vale of a ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet coat, as the mithridate of Medicines (triacle I mean) is extracted out of the bowels of moſt poyſoning woormes.</p>
            <p>I ſpeake not this for mine owne lucres ſake. For as Iſocrates ſaith in his pareneti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call oration to Nicocles, I am not ſo baſeminded to marchandize bookes, although my want may ſtand in need to your Lordship, &amp; vrge me to craue your fauour, when my merits deſerue no meed.</p>
            <p>I am not ignorant that there be ſome, who will be as free of a good word to Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotimus, as a poore man is of his harueſt: who, for that they hate me vnaduiſedly, will
<pb facs="tcp:10522:3"/>
indiſcreetly beat my dog: &amp; becauſe they enuy Melbancke with a peaſantly deſpite, will diſpraiſe all his doings, though they be for their profit.</p>
            <p>Plaine dealing is a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ewel, (though they that vſe it commonly die beggers) and ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will I ſpeake plainly without a parable, though my ſimplicitie may impeach me of follie. If they like it, let them vſe it, and if they loth it, let them refuſe it: If they ſpite it, let them not ſpare, ſo they will promiſe to amend it: and when this promiſe hath perfourmance, then will I cancell all my mallice: But then I feare me they shal experiment, that it is eaſier to ſpie a beam in an other mans eye, then to pull a moat out of their owne: that it is harder to ſee a great ſtaine in the mantle that is behind them, then to ſee a little wrinkle in a gown before them: &amp; leſſe difficill to ſay in an other mans edifice, this ſtone lies not ſquare, then eyther like Vigetius and Columel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>la to preſcribe true rules of Architecture, or like Beſaleel, Ooliab, or Hiram of Tyre, to buyld an houſe by good Geometrie.</p>
            <p>The buckler to breake of all theſe blowes, is your Lordships fauourable patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, which if you will deigne to beſtow vpon me, I shall ſafely be defended from all their garboyles. The burthens which they lay vppon me with all their might, of them your little finger shall eaſely vnburthen me: Their malicious fire wherewith they would ſtiffle me, your very breath shall quickly extinguish: One dram of the quinteſence of wormewood will repell any poyſon, and one good woord of your good will, thall refell all their morninges.</p>
            <p>Thus wiſhing your Lordship as many proſperous yeares, as vertuous properties, and no fewer vertues, then the Sea hath ſandes, And commending both me and mine to your honourable protection, I humbly take my leaue this 28. of Nouember.</p>

            <p>Good Gentlemen, pardon the faults that are paſſed in printing, omit the eſcapes that are com<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mitted by my negligence, and take that vvel in vvoorth, which I wish vvere more then vvel.

In ſo much, that as when <hi>Iupiter</hi> &amp; <hi>Iuno</hi> were at contention, whether man or wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man were more prone to lechery, they elected <hi>Tyreſias,</hi> by whoſe

arbitriment they would be determined, bycauſe he had bene both manne and woman: ſo if there were a controuerſie, which of the Gods were moſte worthy wonder in their excellente workes, I think none more indifferent to decide the matter, then this yong gentleman: in whoſe courtly complexions (ſo ſwete was <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi>) and curteous conditions (ſwete louely <hi>Philotimus</hi>) the expreſſe Images of their heauenlye Deities were ſo liuelye por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed. And yet if <hi>Philotimus</hi> ſhoulde giue his cenſure, which of their powers he thought moſt puiſſant, though he haue felt their mighty operations, and ſo might iudge: yet doe I weene his beſt reſolution would onely be ſilence. For as an Vnicorne hauing moſt ſtrength, doth leaſt knowe it: ſo he hauing greateſt pith, did moſt pitty himſelfe. Notwithſtanding that the Gods being cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riuals in the framing of him, and neuer one ſuffering a fellowe cockmate in this ioint labour, they all doing beſte w<hi rend="sup">t</hi>out compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon it was hard to iudge who did the worſt, euen y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> worſt being placed in the ſuperlatiue degrée. Which his parentes marking, and meruailing at it, thought themſelues eſpecially bounde to be carefull on him, leſt either nature wanting nurture, it ſhould be mard in making, and ſo the Gods offended with their will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full negligence: or his good diſpoſition being at libertie, hauing no leader but his owne diſcretion, they mighte reape leſſe plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in vewing his good lucke, hauing taken no paynes in his bringing vp. They therefore knowing that a younge colte muſt be vſed to the bitt before he come to the ſaddle, that ſprigs ſprout the better if they be lopped, chuſe rather to bee niggardes in pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching him of pence, then procure his nicenes with vaine prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gallitie, rather liking a wan looke that comes of moderate diet, and bewrayes a painfull ſtudent, then a freſh ruddy chéeke that is died with <hi>Bacchus</hi> his buries, and breedes ſuſpition of luſte.</p>

               <p>Indeed euery thing hath a beginning (as the paraſite told his maiſter, which ſaid he toke his ſeruaunt for no liar, and now had ſound it contrary) and therefore we muſt worke by lyne and lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and not leape ouer the ſtile, before we come at it.

               <p>Were it not very abſurd for one that hath no ſkill to begin to build an houſe, and laye the foundation, ſaying that by building he would learne to build? or for maides being ſcarſe borne, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to bride it, and ſay in ſo doing they woulde learne to wiue

               <p>But indeed to giue any great regarde to wealth at all, more then to expell cold, and ſuſtaine nature, is nothing but vanitye.

               <p>
                  <hi>Aurelia</hi> ſaid <hi>Philotimus,</hi> is in a waking womans dreame, ſhee dreames of cheeſe, and ſpeakes of chalke, ſpeakes of my preſence, and craues my abſence. But though I come like ill weather, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent for, yet farewell froſt is not ſo ſoone ſaide. Her aunſwere is like <hi>Apollo</hi> his <hi>Oracle,</hi> that may not be aſſoiled but with doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full interpretations, and therefore I will aſſay to anatomize her meaning. I am as welcome to her, as water into a ſhip, and if I will be gone, Gods bleſſing be with me ſhall-be mine almes.</p>
               <p>Nay, ſtay there <hi>Philotimus,</hi> (aunſwered <hi>Aurelia) Iuno</hi> turned them that troubled the head of the fountaine into frogges, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore recall your ignoraunte Paraphraſe, neither note ſo faſte in the margent, without better vnderſtanding, leaſt for corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the text, ſome penaltie befall you. But ſeth I meane to bee angry with you, I will ſhewe yow the cauſe of all my garboile. Your late compacted iourney, was not ſo ſmothered in hugger mugger, but that I had a litle bird, that brought me newes of it: &amp; when I heard it, I was aggreued, as ſicke as a chick, but much more was I angry, when being in your mouth, (as <hi>Plotina</hi> ſaid) you ſpit me out like a ſluttiſh morſel and being your next neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and of a little acquaintaunce, you woulde not remember all this vacant time, to let me haue notice of your intent, but left me deſolate, taking your flight ſodeinly, &amp; now when I haue you, you are gone againe by this time:</p>
               <p>Alas ſaid <hi>Philotimus,</hi> the bound muſt bend, if thou doeſt but recount the contentes of my goodwill, which I knowe thou haſt capitulated in thy memoryall, thou wilte rue the inteſtine war, which all this while I haue endured in my fancy towardes thee, and the duety towardes my father: at length I am comd to raun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome my ſelfe from euill ſuſpition, to repreſent my gratefullnes, and preſent my ſeruice to thy good conſideration.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philotimus,</hi> I ſuppoſe, had the vertue of the herbe <hi>Nepenthes</hi> in his phiſnomy, which could ſacke ſorrowe, and make his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triſſe

               <p>If any tongue in the worlde deſerue to bee guilded, it is thine <hi>Philotimus,</hi> for thou canſt ſo portcolize thy faults, that if they be blacke, they are engrayled with blew, and if they be redde, thou makeſt them white, wherin, as in other properties, ſo in this y<hi rend="sup">u</hi> reſembleſt the fayre lilie, which being of a ſcarlet coulor within, is in outward aſpect as hory as the ſnow. But I remit thy crime howſoeuer or whitherſoeuer thou wenteſt, thoughe it were a fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritting for other mens conies. One dramme of curteſie with you, maye ſerue for a whole pounde of diſcurteſie, I hadde rather be woonne with an apple, then thou ſhouldeſt ſaye I would bee loſt with a nutte, a becke of yours, is as good as a <hi>Dieugarde.</hi>

               <p>If it were the part of a Iudge to reſpect parcialitie, I ſhoulde percaſe remember my maiſters Euening brawlinges, and Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning whippinges, which many a time God knowes, poore I doe feele, heare, and vnderſtand. But I would you wiſt, <hi>Parmenio</hi> hath emulation for truſtines, with <hi>Anthony</hi> the Oratours ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaunt, who being rackte and torturde to giue teſtimony againſt his maiſters adultery, when he had played faſte and louſe with a pretty wench, would rather endure to die, then make an <hi>Apoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lips</hi> of his maiſters priuities; therefore with warrantize of my vpright dealing, now to the purpoſe.</p>

His inſurrections appeaſed in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, he returned home, <hi>Conons</hi> wyfe was earneſt with her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band (hoping thereby for reward) to preſent the king with ſome rapes, in remembraunce of ould acquaintaunce. <hi>Conon</hi> condtſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cended, tooke his ſtaffe, and filled his wallet: but being hungrie by the way, eat all his rapes ſauing one, which comming to the court, and waiting where the king ſhould paſſe by, he preſented to his maieſti. The noble king acknowledged his old hoaſt, toke his gift well in worth, and commau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ded it to be kept among his beſt iewels, and him to dine at his owne table, and perceiuinge after dinner that <hi>Conon</hi> wiſhed to be walkinge homeward to <hi>Siſlye</hi> his wife, he gaue him a thowſand crownes in lieu of his rape.</p>
               <p>An odd gentleman about the court, ſeeing ſo baſe a preſent repaid with ſo ample recompence, thinking with a ſhift of a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gift to obtaine the like gaine in cooſning the king, beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on him a greate horſe of no ſmall valuation, imagininge that if the king requited the rapes with a M. crownes, he ſhould bee inriched with greate poſſeſſions.

At length, the king rounded one in his eare, that he ſhould ſet him the rape which laye faire wrapt vp in a peece of veluet in his

cloſet which brought, the king gaue it the gentleman, tellings him there was a iewell of a thouſand crownes waight, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of his horſe: my ioyfull gentleman with knee bent, &amp; hand kiſſed, and ten thouſand humble thankes to his noble lieg Lord, receiued the reward<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> therevpon he departed the preſence, longing to vnfould the veluet, where he looked for mounteines of mynes, which as we ſay, brought foorth nothing elſe but a ſie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie dragled mouſe, a worthles poore withered rape.

               <p>Nay ſaid <hi>Philotimus,</hi> a litle chafed with arguing: It was <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> opinion, that rewardes and puniſhments were vphoulders of the Citie, and therefore ſince one muſt nedes doe beſt, let your cenſure of our doinge, geue him rewarde of the beſt.

               <p>
                  <hi>Aemilius</hi> as one <hi>ex Academica,</hi> thinking himſelfe able to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine any controuerſy, and ſomthinge moued with the indurate ſtubbornenes of his frend <hi>Philotimus,</hi> had him proue that, and hent the honour.</p>

                  <hi>Philotimus</hi> briefly concluded in this manner, <hi>Iupiter</hi> hath the dominion ouer all the Gods It is monſtruous for one bodye to haue <hi>2.</hi> heads: all y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> members are ruled by one hart: all the parts of the Ship ſtand vnder one kéele: cranes follow one crane: the heard hath one ſhepheard: one buſhe faith the Prouerbe, can not harbour two Robin redbreſtes: more warres haue beene raiſed, bycauſe manye woulde commaunde, then by their diſobedience which would not be commanded.

               <p>
                  <hi>Aemilius</hi> aunſwered: The ſimilitude of God may not be drawne to man. Libertie being the greateſt gift, that the Gods beſtowe vpon men, by what reaſon ſhoulde one mans authoritie take a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the libertie of ſo many men? One mans iudgement is ſoone ſubdued to euill affectes, as one bucket of water is ſooner poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, then many ſeuerall veſſells.

<pb n="84" facs="tcp:10522:49"/>
the compariſon of your Shepheard will not hould. For if the flocke be great, the Shepheards muſt be many. Againe, the whole flock is of a ſociable, agreaunt, and vniforme nature, neuer diſday<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his fellow, or Lordinge ouer him, neither féeling the yoke of any gouernment. One Cittie hath bene gouerned manye hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred yeares by a Senate, that ruled more quietly then any King, hauing kinges of many Prouinces vnder it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philotimus</hi> replied: It is not libertie to liue as we liſt, but by the lawe and ordinaunce enacted by Nature, ſome to gouerne, as the moſt wiſe and vertuous, ſome to obey, as leſſe excellente in giftes. And bycauſe it ſemes hard, that one ſhould rule all, the Gods haue promiſed to rule the hartes of Kinges and Princes, as <hi>Vlyſses</hi> ſaith in the ſecond of <hi>Homers Iliades.</hi> He ſaith alſo in the ſame place: Great fame and high renowne, are thinges deau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, and of weight, if they be marſhalled in a King. As it is eaſy for one veſſell to bee infected: ſo is it eaſier to finde one abſolute man, then a multitude méete for an entire Empice. Euery one of the Kinges that were ſubiect to that Senate, ruled his ſeueral Prouince by himſelfe, as well as the Senate did all in one. Laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, there is one chiefe in euerye Senate, to whome the reſte doe ſome obeyſaunce, and in whoſe ſentence they ſtand and reſt.</p>
               <p>Here <hi>Aemilius</hi> ſawe himſelfe in the lapſe, and almoſt drawne drye of all replies, &amp; weried with perturbaunce of this ciuill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſention, with theſe or ſuch like wordes yeelded himſelf.</p>
               <p>Whether victorie be an appurtenaunce of a rightful cauſe, or a ſubtill conueyaunce of thy ſleight matter, hath bleared our eyes, I knowe not: or whether enorme cauſes doe want ſolyd matter, or a trewantlike barriſter muſt nedes be pitched ouer the peark, now it boots not: but to co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>diſcend to our couenau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t wherwith we are combined, as I graunte me ouercomen in our latter diſcuſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſo I giue thee the <hi>Trophees</hi> of all our diſceptations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philotimus,</hi> who was euer more couetous to be accounted fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous, then willing to heare his land exalted, returned his fren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des curteſie in theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>If there bee anye credit in takinge theſe prayſes, whiche I

haue receiued, what honour muſte bee in the gifte of this credit, which thou haſt beſtowed? And ſince you are ſo willing to depart with al your glory now of a ſodeine, I wil not do like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> alehouſe clerckes, that deuide the world into foure partes, and take thrée to themſelues: for I will not onely make partition of the whole, but binde my ſelfe gratefull to requite it as I may.</p>
               <p>By this time they were come to their lodging, which now they neyther looked for, nor all this while had thought on, where re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe they themſelues till the next morrow.</p>
               <p>The morning following, as they rid parling of ſuch matters as were obuious, <hi>Senior Mondaldo,</hi> which neuer miſpent time vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fruitfully, interrupted their talke with theſe words.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>PHilotimus</hi> and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> ſith we haue nothing at this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, wherewith to bee well occupied, and you were ſtaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with yeſter dayes Diſputation, I will preſcribe you cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Inductions to be performed at the Vniuerſitie, which if you follow, you ſhall neither repent you of your preſent atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, nor repine at the proſpering of other Gentlemen: and bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe contrary to ordinary, you are grounded in the liberal arts, which is not vſuall to freſhmen, when they firſt come to ſtudy, I will ſet you downe no childiſhe ſamplers, as though I mente to impleade you of Ignoraunce, but ſuche as ſerue Gentlemen of your eſtate, and maye beſeeme Studentes of a good ſtanding.</p>
               <p>Firſt abaſe not good letters in your imagination: for their art is more behoofull for the gouernement of Gentlemen, then their want is materiall for a priuate Subiect. When <hi>Camillus</hi> trium<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phed ouer the Frenchmen the day of his victorye, he wrote theſe woordes in the <hi>Capitoll</hi> of <hi>Rome: Thou haſt bene mother to all Wiſemen, &amp; ſtepdame to all Fooles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Be ſtudious in your learning, but not ſottiſh in your labours: for moderate paines imploied in due times, increaſeth knowledg without bodilye dammage, when intricate endles triuious toy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, plunge the wits, and crucifie the carcas.</p>
               <p>Trifle not your times in vaine ſettes of wordes, but let your greateſt trauailes be Philoſophicall Inſtitutions: for it is not
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:10522:50"/>
hard for the Tayler to ſhape a fitte garment for a ſtraight bodie, but it is impoſſible for a crooked body to be framd by his art to fit a ſtreight garment. It was one of <hi>Socrates</hi> his <hi>Emblems,</hi> that he is eloquent inough, that deliuers his minde plainly.</p>
               <p>Amonge all other Artes, forgett not the <hi>Mathematikes.</hi> for the <hi>Etymologie</hi> of their name, exhortes you to learne them.</p>

               <p>Haue a ſight in all Languages, though it bee but ſuperficiall: for ſo you ſhall be Citizens in all Countreyes, and be able to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate their condicions and manners: and that which is not ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified in ſome of our Languages, is explaned to the full in an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Tongue.</p>
               <p>For preceptes to be eloquent in any one Tongue, I canne aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne you no reſolute certeintie: For neither are all Orators taught by one maiſter, (ſaith <hi>M.

Sweete were the ſauce would pleaſe ech kind of taſt, ſtraung were the veine that ſome man thoughte not vaine: yet that which is generally receiued of all, is conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for you. Firſt in your entraunce to euery Tongue, reade thoſe Authors which ar ſound without blemiſh, as <hi>Caeſar, Tully,</hi> &amp; <hi>Terence,</hi> in the Latin tongue: for <hi>Liuye</hi> &amp; <hi>Saluſt,</hi> chiefteynes of Antiquaries, being generallie perfitte touching their whole woorks, but mancate here and there with ſome ſcattering faults, are not to be neclected of the Students in Eloquence, but to bee diligently read of thoſe that haue iudgement. Secondarily mark their phraſe &amp; Elocution, &amp; then that which is commonly light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly regarded, be painfull to make a ſwete round number. An ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of this number, doth <hi>Sturmius</hi> point out in the beginning of <hi>Tully</hi> his Oration for <hi>A. Cecinna,</hi> the verye firſte Sentence, of which, bycauſe <hi>Tully</hi> ſpeakes ſomewhat, and <hi>Hermogenes</hi> at large, I omit to treatiſe any thing at all.</p>
               <p>Of all other thinges, be charie of your companie. For we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly ſay, that like will to like, and gather ſuſpition of ones diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, by his compéeres. When great <hi>Scipio</hi> came from the

               <p>To make recapitulation of all their communication they had by the way, were more troublous to my pen, then now it can in tend, and therefore intermitting all interlacing of many a good diſcourſe nothing vnprofitable, I will bring them now at length to their wiſhed Vniuerſitie, where thus muche I can ſay in the yong Gentlemens behalfe, but in eſpeciall of <hi>Philotimus,</hi> that in application of his booke, he was as induſtrious, as if his liuinge had layd on his Learning, and ſo curious &amp; circumſpect in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teyning of his credit, that he onely was the man, whome all men admired. In all points of learning <hi>Philotimus</hi> was commended, in all compariſons <hi>Philotimus</hi> excepted, in all exceptions <hi>Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timus</hi> preferred.</p>
               <p>His lyfe was more vertuous, then his lyne was noble, and more notorious was his vertue, then the brute of his bloud, and his name better credifed, then his perſonage acquainted.</p>
               <p>In one and the onely thinge that belonges to an <hi>Orator,</hi> in ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigntie of ſtile, &amp; a ſwete and treatable pronunciation, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded all others of whom I haue read.

               <p>His manners were milde, and very amiable. For though hee were of a cholerick ſanguine complexion, whoſe operation doth vſe to make his Subiecte ſodeine: yet he coulde ſo well refraine his choler, and make exchaunge for cheuiſaunce of curteſye, that theſe Sentences were often rowling in his mouth. <hi>Ariſt.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Thoſe are fools, which cannot be angry at an occaſion:</hi> But <hi>Plato</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Thoſe are more fooles, which will be angry with out great occaſion.</hi> I well beléeue <hi>Ariſt.</hi> for he ſeldome lieth, but I will follow <hi>Plato,</hi> for he thought it ſinne to lye.</p>
               <p>His body was decently made, &amp; featlye framed, conteyning an abſolute conſtitution, and conuenience of liniaments: his head

               <p>This for the moſt part was his behauiour.

I beſeech you Sirs, ſpeake low, leaſt <hi>Philotimus</hi> heare, for this is ſomtime his walk, where he takes the ayre. And arguing on a time on ſome Sophiſticall pointes, with a Gentleman named <hi>Papius,</hi> who ſtoode very ſtiflye to his owne aſſertion, &amp; ouerheated with chafinge and anger in diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, condemned <hi>Philotimus</hi> for an hereticke in Philoſophy: then (quoth <hi>Philotimus</hi>) I appeale to <hi>Papius</hi> when hee is ſober, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate the diſſention.

               <p>It was natiue to <hi>Aemilius</hi> his nature, to counteruaile all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iuries with a contrary counterbuffe, and neuer to die in the debt of his treſpaſſours.

                  <hi>Philotimus</hi> his frendſhip &amp; <hi>Aemilius</hi> his, by this time was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, and as one God could not vadoe that which another did, ſo what either of them auouched, the other would not diſanull.</p>
               <p>His ioy was moſt full euery way, till time it pleaſed God to viſit <hi>Mantua,</hi> and therein his fathers houſe with a greuous mortalitye and plagne, whereof ten of his brethren and ſiſters died, ſo that onelye one ſiſter named <hi>Fuluia</hi> (beſids his father and mother) was ſuruiuor. Of theſe newes <hi>philotimus</hi> heard no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing till the reſidue were amended, the towne and his fathers houſe cleare from the plague, when the Lord <hi>Cleocritus</hi> and the Lady <hi>Caſtibula,</hi> meaning to ſolace their ſorrowes with his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, ſent for him home.</p>
               <p>About this time was <hi>philotimus</hi> greatelye troubled in minde, he knew not whye, and the very ſame night his fathers men came to <hi>Florence,</hi> he dreamed fearefully. The ſeruaunts were vnwilling abruptly to ſhew him theſe vnwelcom newes, and therefore foretelling <hi>Mondaldo</hi> and <hi>Aemilius,</hi> deſired them to vſe the matter ſo, as their yong maiſter might not take it to much to hart. The next day, <hi>philotimus</hi> rehearſed what fearefull dreames he had, vſing theſe wordes.

               <p>He feared leſt as <hi>Sextus</hi> was forewarned in his ſleepe by a dead man, of the heading of his father, ſo theſe apparitions ſhould forhight ſome drouping daunger</p>

               <p>At laſt <hi>Mondaldo,</hi> after much talke, demaunded this Queſtio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: whether if he had diuers precious Iewells in a Shippe, whereof two or three Gemmes were of more valuation in his accounte, then all the reſt, and the Ship ſhould ſuffer wracke theſe onelye ſaued, he would more lament the loſſe of his Iewells, or reioice at the ſafetie of his Gemmes. <hi>Philotimus</hi> aunſwered, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> though a litle griefe daunt a great deale of ioy, as a litle leauen leauens a great trough of dough, yet if his Gemmes were of ſuch woorth as is ſuppoſed, they would be a good comfort to ſo bitter a corſine.

               </p>
               <p>At theſe woordes <hi>Philotimus</hi> ſcritched out, &amp; as a diſtraughte Beolemer, vnuiſedly raued againſt all the highe Aethereall po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers.

               <p>Here <hi>Mondoldo</hi> rebuked him, and told him, he knew not with whoſe folly to counterpeize his frenſie, except with <hi>Heracleates Dioniſius</hi> his, who hauing learned of <hi>Zeno</hi> to be hart-hole in all afflictions, aſſoone as he felt a litle paine in his reines, bad Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline adew, &amp; fainted in his ſickenes.</p>

                     <p>Ah <hi>Aurelia,</hi> faine would I ſinge, but furie makes me fret, and rage hath ſworne to ſéeke reuenge of wronge.

                     <p>Good ſimple ſoule, would you picke a quarrell with them, that as you ſay, would picke a thanke with me? Alas pretie figboy, an haſill twigge in your hande, is an whole haulbarde.</p>
                     <p>Thou arte better to bee a gunner vnder a Ladies targett, then Lieutenaunt of a pitched fielde. Indéed? And is your barking tongue turnd to biting téeth? you are now fleſhed in impudencie. If you be chafed you ſhal be walked, if you be hot you may be coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.

                           <p>For the ſecond, that for example, which <hi>Eutropius</hi> writeth, that at the inſtant of the birth of Chriſt, brake vp a ſpringe of oyle in an Inne of <hi>Rome,</hi> which ran by the ſpace of one whole day. <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſter</hi> ſayeth in his hiſtory, that at the dedicating of a temple to y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> Goddeſſe <hi>Peace, Apollo</hi> gaue oracle, y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> til a virgin bare a ſon it ſhould ſtand, which they thought would neuer be, and therefore y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> for euer it ſhould perſiſt.

                  <seg rend="decorInit">N</seg>Ow Sir, <hi>Philotimus</hi> began to recounte <hi>Archaretos</hi> his letters, &amp; to take account of his paſſed life, howe he ſhould deſerue his paſſing goodwill: hee pondered what might bee the cauſe of the renuing of his goodwill, which hee thought had bene ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete and aboliſhed. I muſe quoth he, yet know not, I meuaile, yet cannot coniec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He was guilty of former contempt, in regard of <hi>Archaretos,</hi> and fearfull of preſent guile, to rewarde his proud haughtines: he did well know his méeknes in maners, yet did he feare leaſt he mocked his miſeries: he had proued his true meaning in the effect of his dealinges, yet doubted leaſt his perſwaſions were a mean to deceiue him: he had experienced his frendly affectio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, yet did expect that <hi>Archaretos</hi> being expert of his pouertie, would be procurde by this allurement to repay his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſhnes. Alas (quoth he thus quoting theſe ſurmiſes) will hee worke me this deſpite, becauſe I haue deſpiſed him? he may if he will, but the valure of his might is nothing the more. The ſtrey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing of a gnat is not ſwallowing of a cammell: an action got in law by a falſe inqueſt, is no lawfull commenſe, nor lawdable co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

Though honour har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>borow y<hi rend="sup">t</hi> vs but for on houre, yet homely honeſtie will kéepe her old neſt: though my curriſhnes be a ſigne that hee ſhould delude me, yet his conſtancie hath ſined to perpetuitie of loue. Howe can it be that he ſhould ſeeke meanes to bereaue mee of breath, who ſtudieth to ſtrengthen and lengthen my life? No no, his frendſhip is firme, &amp; my affection ſhal be reciprocal: he endeuoreth to broch a better tap to make my beare go better downe, &amp; therfore I wil not ſay nay, but aſſay to drinke, apply me to his pleaſure, and be correſpondent to his counſaile.

                  <p>Deare <hi>Archaretos,</hi> forget and forgeue my paſſed ingratitude: for then for want of yeares &amp; good diſcretion I could not diſcerne my frendes (as whelpes cannot ſee till they bee nine dayes olde)

               <p>Alas (good <hi>Philotimus</hi>) my feare did euer deuine this hap, though my well wiſhing impugned my preſagings. But a man ſhal hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be deceiued, where his heart doth fully aduertiſe him.

               <p>Not verie far of, there was a valley thicke with Pineapple &amp; Cipreſſe trees, that armed were with prickes, and in the furtheſt end thereof, there was a pleaſaunt boure vaulted with the leauy trees: by nature it was wal<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Into this valley had an olde Shepheard (whoſe name was <hi>Laurus</hi>) forced with heate, brought his flocke, and hee ſitttinge vnder a pineapple tree, was reading on an old motheaten booke.</p>

               <p>If pleaſures be in painfulnes, if ioyes accord with carefulnes, if mirth may be in miſerie, if baniſhment bee libertie, then am I moſt pleaſant, moſt ioifull, moſt merie, moſt frée: but ay lady mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, I am quite the contrary.</p>
               <p>I am a captiue clapt in chaines of care, lapt in the lawes of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thall loue, &amp; as the dogge all onely for the taſte doth gnawe the bone: ſo forth I drawe this irked life with fancies vaine repaſte. My corſiues comfort is but this, that as a ſiedged forte with for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein force, for want of ayde muſt yéelde at laſte: ſo this my corps thus courſt with cares, for want of eaſe ſhall quickly fade.</p>
               <p>I haue frendes (or had frendes) whom if good nature had taught to goe vpright, when they learned to hault of wayward will, I had not bene a preſident of miſchiefe, nor néeded preſent counſell, I had bene better aduiſed, then now to néede aduertiſement, my winged deſire had not bene clogged with deſpaire, neyther had I had this clue of care to worke my warpe vpon.</p>
               <p>My fame had not fayled, nor my fortune quayled, nor this bloom of my blame, bred of the ſéede of their ſhame. My Courtiers ſtéede had not bene turned to a Colliers cut, nor paſſed welth to preſent wante: I had not bene expelled from mine owne countrie, nor here expoſed to the wrecke of fortune.</p>
               <p>Not to make a profound parable of a plaine brobleme, nor to be nyce in concealing that, which all the world doth know, I will diſcloſe ſome part of my follies, which haue bene the cloſe procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers of my fall.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="213" facs="tcp:10522:114"/>I loued a Laſſe (alas why did I ſo?) which made full manye a ſwearing promiſſe, that I ſhould bee the platforme, where ſhee would plante her gooodwill, and the onelye ground where ſhee would graft her grace. But as I was a ſottiſh Aſſe to beleeue a faithles trull: ſo ſhe made me an horned Ox to harniſh my loue.</p>
               <p>Why (quoth the ſhepheard, meaning to driue him out of his dumpes) it is a pointe of a good gardener to plante in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ground, and therefore did ſhe chooſe thy head to graft her ſlips in.</p>
               <p>Good ſhepheard (quoth <hi>Philotimus</hi>) be not too gameſome in ſo heauie a caſe: for play is turned to earneſt, where game maketh loſſe, and theſe merie conceites make but cholericke melancholy. marmalet is no meat for mowers, nor pleaſure a paſtime for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed men: if thou liſte to heare my ſtate, liſten a while to the tenure of my talke.</p>
               <p>I was once a pleaſant moate in my miſtriſſes eye, whiles I had a beame in mlne owne not to diſcerne her dealinges: ſhe the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> had a golden tongue (as <hi>Beroſius</hi> had for his eloquence) when my purſe was ſo prowde, that the lyning was ſiluer: I then ſee her louely when my candle burnt bright, and now ſtinke in her noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrils like loathlie ſnuffe, when my light is extinct. When my wealth was firſt broched, I was ſweete to her taſte, but ſince it came to the dregs, ſhe ſhuns me like poyſon. When the hony dew of gold did droppe vpon her fingers, and fortune flowed with full ſtreame, then was I worthye to be maiſter of her barge, but ah nowe. Yet I wiſh her longe proſperitie, and my preſent death.</p>
               <p>Truely (quoth the ſhepheard) and for thy ſake (though I haue as litle acquaintaunce with thée, as thou haſte credit with her) I wiſh with all my heart, ſhe were with <hi>Charles</hi> the fourth Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of that name. Yet I requeſt not thy death before his time: for I hope thou ſhalt eat of the gooſe that ſhall tread on her graue. But I perceiue thou art no good Grammarian, that preferr eſt y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> feminine gender to the maſculine, and thy miſtriſſes loue before thine owne ſafetie.

and ſince I could not ſupport her lacke, I would learne of reaſon to ſuppreſſe my loue.</p>

                  <hi>Philotimus</hi> looking vpon him, neither backward nor forward, but like y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> picture of the ſielie man <hi>Dulius,</hi> pitifully God knows, and verie wiſtlie, ſighed out theſe wordes.</p>
               <p>O father ſhepheard, whiles thou endeuoreſt to ſtaunch a veine in my liner, thou letteſt me bloud in the very heart: thou cutteſt the graſſe, whereof I meant to make my hay, which though it now be a common for others to graze in, yet I loue it the better, bycauſe it might haue bene my frehold.

               <p>If I had <hi>Gyges</hi> his facultie, to goe vnſeene into my country, it were ynough for me but to vew her.</p>
               <p>I confeſſe that by her meanes I am a ſcorne to the beſte, and a ſcum of the worſt, I expect no good by her, but ſuſpect a propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of my miſfortunes: yet nowe to forſake her after my longe loue, were to buy fiſh and giue it to the dogges, and to take thy barren counſaile in theſe affaires, were as if a calfe ſhould ſucke a bull. O ſhepheard, muche water paſſeth beſides the mill that the milner ſeeth not, and much hath happened within the compas of thy experience, whereof thou tookeſt litle keepe. I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the for a cunning ſhepheard when I know thy ſkill, &amp; will thanke thee for thy curteſie, but not take thee for a counſalour.</p>
               <p>The good ſhepheard quietly aunſwered. My good child, bicauſe I doe ſee thee ſo vncapable of good counſaile, in ſteade of a Roſe to yeelde a ſwete ſauour, I was a thorne in thy noſe to ſtirre the vp to ſence, I ſpoke ſharplie, but ment fatherly. Be yet of good cheare (my ſonne) behind the doore ſtandes the wall, and <hi>Tyme</hi> holdes the glaſſe of thy good fortune. But in the meane ſeaſon, I doe ſo much the more lament thy caſualties, for that thou and I haue bene birdes of one feather, payed tribute to one <hi>Caeſar,</hi> &amp; bene fellowe ſoldiours in the ſame legar: ſo that hee which hath my miſaduentures, and is enthralled with thy preſente ſtate, maye vie the paire for ſorrowe, whatſoeuer the ſtake be.</p>
               <p>Notwithſtanding, though thou whoſe ſtate was once extol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, arte nowe controuled of checkmate ſpite, and diueſted from thy throne, deſpaire not tho as a miſcreaunt, nor deſtruſte thy poſſibilitye.

as great humilitie, as I vnaduiſedly ſollicite my ſuite. So it is my good ſeruaunt, that my prouident care to preſerue my ſtate, &amp; thy ſober diſcretion in all thy dealings, induce me to thanke thée for thy truſtie pollicie, and to craue thée for my phear and lawful huſband. Yet I beſéech thee impute not this to luſt (for ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations are placed in my preterpect tenſe, but refer it to the vertue of thy good demeanour, which hath a force attractiue, to drawe all heartes to it.

               <p>I aunſwered her in theſe or the like wordes.</p>
               <p>My good miſtris, your meritorious charitie hath ſo long relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued me, and your preſent curteſies offer mee ſuche kindnes, that for y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> one you may challeng me to be your vaſſal, &amp; with the other you haue ſtricke mee into a maze.

               <p>Yet this I will tell you, which perhaps you haue heard: when the <hi>Moone</hi> which is y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> loweſt planet, is in coniunction with <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turne</hi> which is the higheſt planet, there can no good natiuitie iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue from them: when <hi>Winter</hi> marries <hi>Summer,</hi> write it vp for a woonder, and when an old grift in a yonge plante fructifies good fruite, y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> yeare will pippins be preſeruatiue from y<hi rend="sup">e</hi> plague: The greenenes of my youth, and the grauitie of your yeares, are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordes in deſcante, and therefore can they neuer make good mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke.

               <p>At this time we brake of, ſhe telling me, that ſhee doubted not but I would be better aduiſed, and I aunſwering, that I wiſhed I could ſatiſfie her expectation. Manye colloquies had wee about theſe matters after this, but her earneſt inſtaunce wrought but my reſiſtau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce, and my waiwardnes, her goodwill. At length with

much adoe, and many entreatings, I got leaue to be manumitted of her ſeruice with her good liking.</p>
               <p>Her reward at my departure was very bountifull, and though my abilitie were too ſlender to make requital, yet was my grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full hearte not vnwilling to bee thankfull..</p>
               <p>Then in the progreffe of my trauaile, my meditation was, what courſe of life to take. And ſince my lignage was obſcure, &amp; my parentage but baſe, I would néedes haue enterpriſed ſome exploite, with the atchieuement of which, I might haue bene to my poſteritie an originall of true gentilitie. Amongſt the reſt, the ſoldiours profeſſion I moſt honoured, and though I had bene trayned vp in learning, and neuer ſeene a lined campe, yet did I thinke that my reading with a litle experience, would affoord me ſuch knowledge as would ſuffice a ſoldiour. <hi>Machaon</hi> and <hi>Poda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The reſidue of my life haue I ledde euer ſince in this vocation, where at my pleaſure I could ſtudie good authours, &amp; be contemplatiue when I liſt, and my manſion houſe is yonder litle cottage, which thou ſeeſt ſtand amid the trées. My name as thou rightly geſſedſt at the firſt, is <hi>Laurus.</hi> Now, if thou canſt either brooke my kinde of life, or accept the néedines of my cheare, I wil either make thée a companion in my callinge as longe as I liue, or geue thee whiles thou liſteſt, ſuche entertainment as I canne.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Philotimus</hi> his humour was frankly fedde with this diſcourſe of the ſhepheard. <hi>Laurus</hi> (quoth he) I gratulate thy preſence, and am glad to ſée thée, much haue I heard of thée which now I will not repeate, and I thinke my ſelfe happie that I haue met with thée But as for thy life, I rather admire it then meane to imitate it.

If thou canſt giue me knowledge of anie Court nere at hande, or any nobleman that wil vouchſafe me his ſeruice, I ſhall thinke my ſelf much beholden to thée. Truly quoth the ſhepheard, in good time: for not manye leagues from hence, doeth ſoiourne a famous and vertuous Gentleman, the prince of this prouince: whoſe peaceable pollicie and diuine gouernment, I cannot rightly match, but with that moſt renowned regiment of the worthye Queene <hi>ELIZABETH,</hi> nowe Queene of <hi>England,</hi> whoſe royall excellencie,</p>
